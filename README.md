Libft
📚 Your very first own library 📚
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Libft is the first project in the 42Network cursus, serving as an introduction to coding where you learn how to create a local library. This library includes existing functions from the libc as well as additional functions developed by you. The project also teaches you how to create a Makefile to manage compilation.

Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C programming can be challenging without access to standard functions. Libft aims to address this by helping you understand, implement, and utilize these functions. By creating your own library, you'll have a valuable resource for future C assignments.

Mandatory Part
---------------------------------------------------------
Program name: libft.a
Turn in files: Makefile, libft.h, ft_*.c
External functs: Detailed in the project specifications
Description: Create a collection of functions that mimic libc functions and additional utility functions.

Bonus Part 🎁
--------------------------------------
Structure: Use a provided structure to represent a node of a list. 🏗️🚧
Functions: Implement additional list manipulation functions. (introduction to single linked list)

🚀 Happy coding! 🚀
