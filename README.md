Libft
ðŸ“š Your very first own library ðŸ“š
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Libft is the first project in the 42Network cursus, serving as an introduction to coding where you learn how to create a local library. This library includes existing functions from the libc as well as additional functions developed by you. The project also teaches you how to create a Makefile to manage compilation.

Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C programming can be challenging without access to standard functions. Libft aims to address this by helping you understand, implement, and utilize these functions. By creating your own library, you'll have a valuable resource for future C assignments.

Mandatory Part
---------------------------------------------------------
Program name: libft.a
Turn in files: Makefile, libft.h, ft_*.c
External functs: Detailed in the project specifications
Description: Create a collection of functions that mimic libc functions and additional utility functions.

Bonus Part
--------------------------------------
Structure: Use a provided structure to represent a node of a list.
Functions: Implement additional list manipulation functions.
Evaluation: Bonus part will only be assessed if the mandatory part is perfect.
Submission and Peer-evaluation
Ensure your project is correctly submitted to your assigned git repository. Peer-evaluation may follow, and grading will be based on the content of the repository.

ðŸš€ Happy coding! ðŸš€
